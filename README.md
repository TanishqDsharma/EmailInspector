# EmailInspector
Email Header Analysis is a web + CLI based project developed with the aim of investigating emails to distinguish malicious emails from genuine ones.

In today’s scenario where everything is going on in online mode and the main mode of communication is through emails, it becomes very difficult to identify fake/phishing emails and because of this the amount of fake/phishing email attacks have increased drastically. Employees with no knowledge about cyber security are the most vulnerable to such attacks and pose a major security concern to their organizations. 

Therefore having a solution to identify such emails with just one click would be a great help to society.
